# LFSR Predictor - Berlekamp-Massey
Predict the output of a LFSR with the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm.

The implementation of Berlekamp-Massey is inspired of wikipedia and https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/11646/Implementation-of-Berlekamp-Massey-Algorithm and can be reused directly.

The main was mostly meant to to be used with small examples in a student project, but can be easily modified to work with other kinds of inputs.
